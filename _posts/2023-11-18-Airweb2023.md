**Exploring Structural AirWebs through AI: A Bio-Inspired Artistic Journey**

by Juan Carlos Dallâ€™Asta, Giancarlo Di Marco, Emanuela Corti, Teo Hidalgo, Ivan Parati with Lok Hang Cheung, Yiyun Liang and Zhe Zhang


The primary objectives of this pro-ject are multifaceted:
1.	To identify and catalogue organic plant frames based on their morphological structures
2.	To synthesize organic structures and generate prototypes, translating nature's structural designs into an artificial imaginative creation
3.	To insert through AI synthesized plant frames into transparent boxes, introducing spiders into this artistic dialogue with nature, resulting in the creation of unique spider webs.
4.	To translate and synthesize these variations into 15 distinct structural morphemes, each representing a unique facet of the organic and the man-made.
5.	To weave these 15 structural morphemes into a spatial structural air web, a mesmerizing and evocative exploration of the intricate con-nections between the natural and the artificial.
