# First try on Stable diffusion (Thanks to [Fast.ai course](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-9-part-2-preview/101336), again!)

Tested a bit following [Jeremy Howard's fast AI course Part 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7rMfsA24Ls)

Attempted to test on local jupyter notebook but too many hardware problems... Then switched to play a bit on Google Colab, leanring to use [Diffusers library by amazing Hugging Face!](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TLYm1VE1q_MgT9ys7iwhyfpT3_o4YxAL?usp=sharing)

Looking forward to slowly continuing the stable diffusion course! (probably after digesting the NLP notebook, which potentially much more related to own research)
Below are some extracted results. (Tested prompts were variations of my master final year project. Interestingly, these images did come up at different times throughout the final year... Although it didn't seem like the [final design](http://www.presidentsmedals.com/Entry-53841))
