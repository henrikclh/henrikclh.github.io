# Hello blog

This is my first post 打中文亦可
Thanks to Jeremy Howard I'm trying to use [fast-page](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2019-05-13-blogging-advice.html) for blogging.

I will continue testing along the [mark down cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) such as *italics*, **bold** and `code font text`.

Also quotation such as:

## Trying to 'type' code

```python
# Prints '2'
# Prints 'Hello Henrik'
print(1+1)
print('Hello Henrik')
```

    2
    Hello Henrik
