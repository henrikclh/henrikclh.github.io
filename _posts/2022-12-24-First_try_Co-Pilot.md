# Christmas coding exercise
- first try on Github [Co-pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), it's amazing!
- created a programme that we can record enter each 'actor''s name, number of m- and p- individuals, action and time.
- then created a .csv for record

## What for?
- coding exercise and workflow from Visual Studio Code to Github ([my first repository](https://github.com/henrikclh/20221224_Converstaion_theory_ex)!)
- just an intention to turn theory into coding

## What's next?
- if an robotic system is built, the data can then be integrated, and recorded with this conversation theory structure (a mature programme version)



## (Stable diffusion Christmas trees!)

And they are all derived from the same original sketch below!
